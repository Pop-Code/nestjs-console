    ConsoleOptions has been replaced by CreateCommandOptions, to update from ^4.0.0 you simply have to change property `name` by `command`.  
    eg: `@Console({name: "myCommand"})` => `@Console({command: "myCommand"})`

### Added

-   All commands and sub commands are stored in the ConsoleService and can be found using the `ConsoleService.getCommand(name: string)`. Name is a command path separated by dots. eg: `parent.command.subcommand`
-   Sub commands can now be registered on other subCommand without any args. If a parent command define options, they can be retrieved using `command.parent.opts()` inside the executed subCommand. This allow you to create group of command with global options based on parent options
